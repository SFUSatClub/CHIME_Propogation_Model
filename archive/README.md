# CHIME_Propogation_Model
We are developing models to help us understand the required parameters for our satellite to
perform as a calibration source for the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) Radiotelescope.

Currently we are developing a forward model and an inverse model:

the forward model:
Calculates the expect signal power received by CHIME from our satellite and errors in the parameters involved. CHIME requires us to deliver expected power measurement with fractional error of less than 0.01. 

the inverse model:
calculates the expected parameters that generated measured signal power at the CHIME radio telescope.
