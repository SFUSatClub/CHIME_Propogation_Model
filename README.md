# CHIME_Propogation_Model
We are developing models to help us understand the required parameters for our satellite to
perform as a calibration source for Canadian Hydrogen Mapping Experiment (CHIME) Radiotelescopes.

Currently we are developing a forward model and inverse model:
the forward model:
calculates the expect signal power received by CHIME from our satellite and errors in the parameters involved.

the inverse model:
calculates the expected parameters that generated measured signal power at the CHIME radio telescope.
